        "\n",
        "### 1. **Apply for API Access**:\n",
        "   - Go to the Upwork API [application page](https://www.upwork.com/developer/keys/apply).\n",
        "   - Fill out the application form with details about your project, including how you plan to use the API.\n",
        "   - Submit the form and wait for approval from Upwork.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Obtain Your API Key**:\n",
        "   - Once your application is approved, you'll receive an API key from Upwork.\n",
        "   - This key is usually provided on the developer dashboard under your API applications. Make sure to store it securely.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Generate an Access Token**:\n",
        "   - Upwork’s API typically uses OAuth 2.0 for authorization.\n",
        "   - You will need to implement an OAuth flow to get an `access_token`. This involves:\n",
        "     - Redirecting users to Upwork's authorization server to log in and grant permissions to your app.\n",
        "     - Handling the authorization callback to capture the authorization code.\n",
